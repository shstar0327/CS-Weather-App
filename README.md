# IF DESIGNER FAILS TO LOAD #

If the designer fails to load, which it does for some reason, dispite the program compiling and executing just fine, please open MainWeatherForm.Designer.cs in Visual Studio and simply enter a new line, and then save it and run the program. The designer than should load.

Thanks.
